/**
 * This class manages the loading of jar files, which would contain new InteractionCommands.
 * The jar files are supplied as an array of URLs.
 * It extends the URLClassLoader and basically forces the supplied jar files to the front of the search
 * down the classpath.
 * It performs the following search:
 *   1) Tries to find the required class loaded in the local classpath.
 *   2) Tries to find the required class in the supplied jar files.
 *   3) Delegates the search to the parent class loader, which will typically be the context class loader from the current thread.
 *
 * If the class is not found a ClassNotFoundException is thrown.
